     * 344. Reverse String
     * Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
     *
     * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
     *
     * You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
     * Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
     * Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
