     * 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
     * Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
     *
     * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Given nums = [1,1,2],
     *
     * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
     *
     * It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
     *
     * Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
     *
     * It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
     * Clarification:
     *
     * Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
     *
     * Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
     *
     * Internally you can think of this:
     *
     * // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
     * int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
     *
     * // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
     * // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
     * for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
     *     print(nums[i]);
     * }

    Solution:
    Set slow fast pointers, when slow != fast, copy fast to slow + 1
    finally subarray from 0 to slow, include slow is the new no dup array

    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1)

        }
        var slow = 0
        for num in nums {
            if nums[slow] != num {
                nums[slow + 1] = num
                slow += 1
            }
        }
        return slow + 1
    }
